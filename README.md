### How it all began
I was in Hyderabad,India. Because, I had to complete my final exams for the 1st year, and that's when my sister and her friends were planning an International trip, Planning a trip is easy but **implementing it** is the hard part. So they've decided to go to **Bali**,Indonesia. That's when, I started to use a thing called Law of attraction, Which I read it off a book called **Secret** by **Rhonda Byrne** which I definitely _recommend_ the readers to read it! Because it has worked for me, If it didn't, Then I wouldn't have gone to _Bali_ ; Here is a [Link](https://www.readingsanctuary.com/the-secret/) to that book. So since I do all the travel arrangements when anyone in my family is planning a trip. My sister has asked me to check out the Flights, Accomodation etc. That's when I started to imagine that I was already in _Bali_ enjoying the beautiful view. That's how it all began.
### What's next?
But Unfortunately, One friend named _Deepti_ has dropped out of the trip because, She was suffering from serious back pain and, We all know, No one want's to get sick when they're abroad on an intention to enjoy the trip rather than being sick and, Her other friend named 
_Radhika_ wanted to come on the trip so badly, But her recent trip to Malaysia made her busy at work and, She decided not to come. So there was only my sister **Akhila** and her friend **Abhijith** whom we call _Abhi_ willing to come to the trip. _Abhi anna_ was strongly determined that this trip will become a reality. So that's where I come in, they planned that if I would come with them we all would visit the _Bali_. So after my final exam, My sister Akhila called my _Mom_ and informed about the plan, She accepeted it on one condition that, I wouldn't miss my college classes after I return from the Trip.

## **On the Final Exam Day** 
My Final exam was Chemistry, I completed my test and, returned back to my home back in Hyderabad. When I returned from the exam, I recieved a call from my sister and she asked me that if I was intrested in coming to the trip. I tripped with _excitement_, that I was going to Bali, I knew it **The Secret** was working. So she also informed that _Abhi anna_ was on his way to our home to plan the trip. He arrived at evening, and, Then we were starting to search for our flights to Bali, with only 15 days left for our estimated departure the flight's weren't cheap. So we booked on Scoot airlines first to Singapore and then to Bali; and, for returning we booked with Airasia from Bali to Malaysia to Chennai and, then on Indigo from Chennai to Hyderabad. And, all the flights invovling in this trip was Airbus A320(Bored of it)(It's a small aircraft, generally used for short-range flights). If you guys are trying to find cheap flights, I recommend trying **SkyScanner** it has the cheapest flights. We then booked our accomodation through **Airbnb** which was quite reasonable and good.

## **26th June:**

### In the Flight:
Evening, We were getting ready for our flight, and I told my sister to come fast so that we have extra time to check the weight of cabin baggage because we were flying **Scoot** aka _the worst airline_, because they charge for even water bottle luckily they were generous while we were checking in, **they offered to check 2 of our bags for free!**. _I hope Airasia will do the same thing!_ And, Then we cut the cake for my sister's bday early because when she will be in Bali when her bday comes!. Phani and Nitya came over we had dinner, Then we went to the Airport! We checked in, There was no web check-in for Connecting Passengers of Scoot. **Luckily,** We got adjacent seats! The crew were good and, I enjoyed the plane in the first 1 hour! Then my stomach was upset for the whole flight! I had to go to Washroom but the captain turned on the SeatBelt sign for the whole flight and, Since I was in a window seat it was difficult for me to go to washroom, I regretted taking the window seat at that time. The first time I went, The turbulence started and, The plane started to shake the crew knocked on the door and, told me to go to my seat, But, I wasn't done yet! My stomach was upset and I wished that never I should have this experience. The second time, I went and tried to use the secret that there was no turbulence at all, Surprisinglyyyyy, the turbulence went off and, I was done with my stomach ache. But, Even though, I had some pain until we were landed in Singapore!.

### AT SINGAPORE AIRPORT:

I tried to sleep in the flight but no I was upset with the Stomach Ache!and to check the flight status, I used GPS and Surprisingly it showed me the location in the sea, I was amazed. Singapore City was so beautiful from above the sky and, I got excited about landing in the world's best Airport the Changi Airport, I wish I had enough time to explore the beautiful airport, We went to the transit desk and we were told that to change the seat there is a fee and, I thought what the hell?!. Then I connected to Changi's WiFi I scanned my passport and, got the WiFi Access key for my Sister!

Then we went to the Sunflower Garden the view was beautiful!!

Then, We went to Mc Donald's because, There was nothing we could eat near the gate except Mc Donald the menu was so much different from Indian one, The google Pay didn't work so we gave USD and they gave change in Singaporean dollar! We went to the gate and, there was security check near the gate(At Changi Airport, Singapore, The security check is at **GATE**), Abhi Anna's Hair Spray was thrown out by security. Because, It was more than 100ml he got so upset. Then, We boarded our flight and, We were assigned the last 3rd row and, The passengers around were making so much noise! Then, I slept as soon I boarded and got up while taking off! There was so much turbulence when we took off! That turbulence was crazy!!!. It was like a roller coaster I enjoyed it so much and at the same time, It was scary!!(I thought to myself, Am I gonna die today, HAHA, No Today's not the day). Then, I was asleep and, I got thirsty and, I tried to ask the crew and she told me the water was 2 dollars and water is only free on Indian planes and, I thought oh my god!(should've asked them on the previous flight.) Then, I tried to use GPS but it didn't work, Then we got descended into Bali. I couldn't film the view because on the Bali Plane, I was assigned an Aisle Seat, Although, I managed to capture a picture from the rear galley of the aircraft. Here is it:

### At BALI Airport:
And then, We got down from plane and got into bus and, There was immigration, It was easy, They stamped but, The stamp was **light!**(I couldn't even see it).Then we dropped our Customs form and, proceeded to Baggage claim. We took our luggage and got out. Then we exchanged around 40 dollars to IDR, To book a cab we should have internet, But the WiFi is only inside Airport after booking a cab, He said he was not allowed onto Arrivals, Then, We got on Elevator and boarded the car! He spoke _little English_ but fine! We arrived and, The neighbours of Loft 99 helped us Check-in the home was a bit dirty, But it wasn't the worst and, Then we unpacked and had shower and, Called mom andc Then we went to the Central Kuta Money Exchange to change currency and, From there, We went to Bali Mal Galleria Mall by walk to take the Sim Card and, To have food we were super hungry as the Scoot people didn't serve food.

### **Going to the mall:**

While going to the mall, We saw a statue kind maybe it was Ramudu and, We entered the mall there were big brands like **Guchi**. But, We couldn't find Grapari Telkomsel. So, we asked a shopkeeper and, She told that we were on the other side of the mall. So, We went to the other mall and, Then we bought a Telkomsel Tourist Simpati Sim Card valid for 14days and, Then we went out and bought Cinnamon Sugar Churros with chocolate dip. It was tasty and, Then we also bought French Fries(It was _OK_) and, Then, We booked a cab to Kuta Beach and, Then, I ate some noodles, It was below average and, Then we spent some time on the beach by chilling in the night and, Then, we went to our Airbnb and, tried to get Motorbikes but no one responded. **We just slept**.

### **27th June:**
![Waterbom](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-waEFCLzMRU/maxresdefault.jpg)

Today, We were getting ready to go to Waterbom Park, We have found a bike dealer, He said he will give us bikes at afternoon today, So, We decided to go to Waterbom by Car, We have gone there and, They gave us a band for locker, First, We proceeded to the locker room, We have put our valuables in the locker and, Then, my sister got changed and, I was already in a swimming attire, We then proceeded to the rides, I gave my spectacles down and, They gave me a band for that, The thing I had most fun was going inside the glass door and, Then the countdown 3,2,1... And then BOOM!! You fall down. That was the crazy part(Literally, You could feel the Adrenaline rush inside your body). And, Then, We rode some rides, and then there was a slide which goes through the closed tube which has disco lights and, Then you go up and go down and into the pool, and then there was Superbowl, It was nice, It was like, a bowl and then you go down and go round and round the cup and I fell down backside and gulped some water.
Here's a photo of the glass slide:

![Watch the video](https://www.waterbom-bali.com/media/wbrides/gallery/Smash_Down_2.0_03.jpg)]

Then we collected our bikes and proceeded to Uluwatu Temple, which was a 1 hour ride from Waterbom, Bali.

## My Magical trip to **Bali**,_Indonesia_

### How it all began
I was in Hyderabad,India because i had to complete my final exams on 1st year,and that's when my sister and her friends were planning an International trip,planning a trip is easy but **implementing it** is the hard part.So they've decided to go to **Bali**,Indonesia.That's when i started to use a thing called Law of attraction which i read it off a book called **Secret** by **Rhonda Byrne** which i definitely _recommend_ the readers to read it!Because it has worked for me,if it didn't then i wouldn't have gone to _Bali_ ;Here is a [Link](https://www.readingsanctuary.com/the-secret/) to that book.So since i do all the travel arrangements when anyone in my family is planning a trip.My sister has asked me to check out the Flights,Accomodation etc.That's when i started to imagine that i was already in _Bali_ enjoying the beautiful view.That's how it all began.
### What's next?
But unfortunaely,one friend named _Deepti_ has dropped out of the trip because she was suffering from serious back pain and we all know, no one want's to get sick when they're abroad on an intention to enjoy the trip rather than being sick,and her other friend named 
_Radhika_ wanted to come on the trip so badly,but her recent trip to Malaysia made her busy at work and she decided not to come.So there was only my sister **Akhila** and her friend **Abhijith** whom we call _Abhi_ willing to come to the trip._Abhi anna_ was strongly determined that this trip will become a reality.So that's where i come in,they planned that if i would come with them we all would visit the _Bali_.So after my final exam my sister Akhila called my _Mom_ and informed about the plan,she accepeted it on one condition that i wouldn't miss my college classes after i return from the Trip.

## **On the Final Exam Day** 
My final exam was Chemistry,i completed my test and returned back to my home back in Hyderabad.When i returned from the exam i recieved a call from my sister and she asked me that if i was intrested in coming to the trip.I tripped with _excitement_ that i was going to Bali.So she also informed that _Abhi anna_ was on his way to our home to plan the trip.He arrived at evening and then we were starting to search for our flights to Bali,with only 15 days left for our estimated departure the flight's weren't cheap.So we booked on Scoot airlines first to Singapore and then to Bali;and for returning we booked with Airasia from Bali to Malaysia to Chennai and then on Indigo from Chennai to Hyderabad.If you guys are trying to find cheap flights i recommend trying **SkyScanner** it has the cheapest flights.We then booked our accomodation through **Airbnb** which was quite reasonable and good.

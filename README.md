### How it all began
I was in Hyderabad,India because I had to complete my final exams on 1st year,and that's when my sister and her friends were planning an International trip,planning a trip is easy but **implementing it** is the hard part.So they've decided to go to **Bali**,Indonesia.That's when I started to use a thing called Law of attraction which I read it off a book called **Secret** by **Rhonda Byrne** which I definitely _recommend_ the readers to read it!Because it has worked for me,if it didn't then I wouldn't have gone to _Bali_ ;Here is a [Link](https://www.readingsanctuary.com/the-secret/) to that book.So since I do all the travel arrangements when anyone in my family is planning a trip.My sister has asked me to check out the Flights,Accomodation etc.That's when I started to imagine that I was already in _Bali_ enjoying the beautiful view.That's how it all began.
### What's next?
But unfortunaely,one friend named _Deepti_ has dropped out of the trip because she was suffering from serious back pain and we all know, no one want's to get sick when they're abroad on an intention to enjoy the trip rather than being sick,and her other friend named 
_Radhika_ wanted to come on the trip so badly,but her recent trip to Malaysia made her busy at work and she decided not to come.So there was only my sister **Akhila** and her friend **Abhijith** whom we call _Abhi_ willing to come to the trip._Abhi anna_ was strongly determined that this trip will become a reality.So that's where I come in,they planned that if I would come with them we all would visit the _Bali_.So after my final exam my sister Akhila called my _Mom_ and informed about the plan,she accepeted it on one condition that I wouldn't miss my college classes after I return from the Trip.

## **On the Final Exam Day** 
My final exam was Chemistry,I completed my test and returned back to my home back in Hyderabad.When I returned from the exam I recieved a call from my sister and she asked me that if I was intrested in coming to the trip.I tripped with _excitement_ that I was going to Bali.So she also informed that _Abhi anna_ was on his way to our home to plan the trip.He arrived at evening and then we were starting to search for our flights to Bali,with only 15 days left for our estimated departure the flight's weren't cheap.So we booked on Scoot airlines first to Singapore and then to Bali;and for returning we booked with Airasia from Bali to Malaysia to Chennai and then on Indigo from Chennai to Hyderabad.If you guys are trying to find cheap flights I recommend trying **SkyScanner** it has the cheapest flights.We then booked our accomodation through **Airbnb** which was quite reasonable and good.

Evening we were getting ready for our flight, and I told my sister to come fast so that we have extra time to check the weight of cabin baggage because we were flying **Scoot** aka _the worst airline_, because they charge for even water bottle luckily they were generous while we were checking in, **they offered to check 2 of our bags for free!** _I hope Airasia will do the same thing!_and then we cut the cake for my sister's bday early because when she will be in Bali when her bday comes!. Phani and Nitya came over we had dinner, Then we went to the Airport!We checked in, there was no web check-in for Connecting Passengers of Scoot, luckily we got adjacent seats!The crew were good and I enjoyed the plane in the first 1 hour!Then my stomach was upset for the whole flight!I had to go to Washroom but the captain turned on the SeatBelt sign for the whole flight and since I was in a window seat it was difficult for me to go to washroom, the first time I went the turbulence started and the plane started to shake the crew knocked on the door and told me to go to my seat,but I wasn't done yet!my stomach was upset I wished that never I should have this experience.The second time I went and tried to use the secret that there was no turbulence at all, Surprisinglyyyyy the turbulence went off and I was done with my stomach ache even though I had some pain until we were landed in Singapore! I tried to sleep in the flight but no I was upset with the Stomach Ache!and to check the flight status I used GPS and Surprisingly it showed me the location in the sea I was amazed.Singapore City was so beautiful from above the sky and I got excited about landing in the world's best Airport the Changi Airport, I wish I had enough time to explore the beautiful airport,we went to the transit desk and we were told that to change the seat there is a fee and I thought what the hell?! Then I connected to Changi's WiFi I scanned my passport and got the WiFi Access key for my Sister! Then we went to the Sunflower Garden the view was beautiful!!Then we went to Mc Donald's because there was nothing we could eat near the gate except Mc Donald the menu was so much different from Indian one, the google Pay didn't work so we gave USD and they gave change in Singaporean dollar! We went to the gate and there was security check near the gate, Abhi Anna's Hair Spray was thrown out by security because it was more than 100ml he got so upset then we boarded our flight we were assigned the last 3rd row and the passengers around were making so much noise!then I slept as soon I boarded and got up while taking off!There was so much turbulence when we took off!That turbulence was crazy!!! it was like a roller coaster I enjoyed it so much and at the same time, it was scary!!Then I was asleep and I got thirsty and I tried to ask the crew and she told me the water was 2 dollars and water is only free on Indian planes and I thought oh shit!Then I tried to use GPS but it didn't work, then we got descended into Bali I couldn't film the view because of the Bali Plane I was assigned an Aisle Seat and then we got down from plane and got into bus and there was immigration it was easy they stamped but the stamp was light!Then we dropped our Customs form and proceeded to Baggage claim we took our luggage and got out.Then we exchanged around 40 dollars to IDR, To book a cab we should have internet but the wifi is only inside Airport after booking a cab he said he was not allowed onto Arrivals then we got on Elevator and boarded the car!He spoke little English but fine!We arrived and the neighbours of Loft 99 helped us Check-in the home was a bit dirty but it wasn't the worst and then we unpacked and had shower and called mom and then we went to the Central Kuta Money Exchange to change currency and from there we went to Bali Mal Galleria Mall by walk to take the Sim Card and to have food we were super hungry as the Scoot people didn't serve food, while going to the mall we saw a statue kind maybe it was Ramudu,and we entered the mall there were big brands like Guchi,but we couldn't find Grapari Telkomsel so we asked a shopkeeper and she told that we were on the other side of the mall so we went to the other mall and then we bought a Telkomsel Tourist Simpati Sim Card valid for 14days and then we went out and bought Cinnamon Sugar Churros with chocolate dip it was tasty and then we also bought  French Fries it was ok, and then we booked a cab to Kuta Beach and then I ate some noodles it was below average and then we spent some time on the beach by chilling in
 the night and then we went to out Airbnb and tried to get Motorbikes but no one responded.
